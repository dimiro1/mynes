# MyNES

A Work in Progress Nes emulator.

## What is done?

- Cycle stepped CPU;
- CHR debug window;
- Most of blargg tests are passing;
- nestests is passing;
- Per-opcode verification against the Tom Harte single step tests;

## Tests

```sh
mvn test
```

That runs everything, including the [Tom Harte SingleStepTests](https://github.com/SingleStepTests/65x02)
for all 256 opcodes against a committed subset of 500 cases per opcode. Each opcode is checked
twice: once for its end state and cycle count, and once for its exact per-cycle bus traffic.

For the full 10,000 cases per opcode, fetch the upstream set once:

```sh
./scripts/download-6502-tests.sh   # ~1.4GB into the gitignored testdata/
mvn test                          # picks the full set up automatically
```

To run only the per-cycle bus trace stage, or to skip it:

```sh
mvn test -Dgroups=bus-trace
mvn test -DexcludedGroups=bus-trace
```
